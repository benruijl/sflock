sflock - simple feedback screen locker
============================

Simple screen locker utility for X, based on
slock. Provides a very basic user feedback.


Requirements
------------

In order to build sflock you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------

Arch Linux users can install this package from the AUR(http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=44802).

Manual installation:
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (sflock is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install sflock
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running sflock
-------------

Simply invoking the sflock command starts the display locker with default
settings.

Custom settings:

-h: toggle the bar.  
-f <font description>: modify the font.  
-c <password characters>: modify the characters displayed when the user enters his password. This can be a sequence of characters to create a fake password.  
-l: do not disable switching to consoles (like Ctrl-Alt-F1). This option does not affect Xorg's DontVTSwitch .
